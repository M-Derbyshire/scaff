SCAFF [commandname] [variablename]=[variablevalue]

SCAFF will work its way up the directory-tree, from the current working directory, searching for a scaff.json file that contains the requested command (if multiple commands are found with the same name, the first one in the array is used).
For full instructions on how to structure commands in a scaff.json file, visit https://github.com/M-Derbyshire/scaff

[commandname] - The name of the command (in a scaff.json file) that defines the files/directories to create.
[variablename]=[variablevalue] - Variables that are needed by the requested command can be defined in this format. See the below examples:

var1=myValue
var2="my longer value"

You can provide multiple variables in this way. If a variable is needed, but not provided, SCAFF will prompt you to provide it.
